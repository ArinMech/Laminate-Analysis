# Laminate-Analysis
Hey There! This is a code written in Python to choose an optimal order of plies to form facesheets for laminates
The code uses Composite Laminate Theory to find the A matrix for the laminate and use it for further analysis
This tool is used to design, analyze, and optimize the ply schedules that a laminate uses
